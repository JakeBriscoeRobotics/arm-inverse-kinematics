# mearm-inverse-kinematics

##Overview
This project implements inverse kinematics to control a MeArm robotic arm.  
The goal is to move the armâ€™s end-effector precisely to a desired position (x, y, z) using mathematical models and code. 

##Forward Mechanics start
Started by measuring the arm from base to joint and joint to elbow etc to setup the start of the forward kinematics

Tested Max possible values 

For elbow: 10 to 140 deg
For shoulder 40 to 180 deg
For Base: 0 to 180 deg
